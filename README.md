An fully functionnal GBxCart 1.3 hardware with a dip40 chip atmega 8515L , easy findable for cheap

i recommande to use a SMT assembly service with the attached BOM and pick and place file , you just need solder a gba slot and the atmega 8515L yourself

Board can be HASL , 1.6mm thickness



the atmega8515L need to be programmed with the correct firmware + bootloader



device designed with the schematic open source from insidegadget , with some changes

firmware + bootloader can be downloaded in attachement ''MCU_Files'' , can be easy programmed with an USBASP device
